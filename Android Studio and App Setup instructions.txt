8.  The app ran for me after these steps on my laptop using the default created emulator.  This was on a fresh Android Studio install which I have not had on this Windows installation so everything should have been fresh.  I didn't run into any problems with the gradle version or sdk version but still don't know if others might.  If anyone has other errors let me know and we can try to troubleshoot them and get them working.
