Naming Conventions:
-All class names should be in capitalized camel case.

    class User;
    class CardGame;
    class CurrentUserHand;

-Interface names follow the same naming conventions as class names.
-Incremental variables should follow the common "i", "j", "k" convention.
-All variables with the exception of incremental variables should be short but meaningful nouns.
-Variables must start with a character, no "_" or other symbols as the first character of a variable.

    int goalNum;
    string userName;

-Instances of a class follow the same conventions as variables.
-Constants should follow the same naming conventions as other variables but be all caps with each word separated by a "_".

    static final int MAX_INDEX;
    static final string EXIT_BUTTON_TEXT = "Exit";

-Methods should be descriptive verbs in camel case.

    private static calculateAverage();
    public static returnUserName();

-Declare variables directly above the block of code in which they are used.

Indentation and Spacing:
-Always indent blocks inside of brackets.
-If a line is extremely long, indent at a "," to help readability and align with the last "(" of the line.

    User newUser = new User(userFirstName, userLastName, userMiddleName, userUserName, userPassword, userEmail, userBirthday,
                            userFavoriteColor, userFavoriteFood, userFavoriteSeason, userMother, userFather, userSiblings[]);

-Key words like "for", "if", and "while" should have a space between them and the conditional that follows.
-A line of whitespace should separate blocks of code that perform different functions as well as method bodies of different methods.

Brackets:
-The starting bracket "{" should always be on the same line as the statement it follows with a space between the two.
-The ending bracket "}" should always have its own line.
-Always include brackets even for single line "if" or "for" statements.
-In "if else" statements the "else" or "else if" should follow the closing bracket of the previous statement.

    public class User {
        private string userName;
    }

    if (num = goalNum) {
        return TRUE;
    } else {
        return FALSE;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < goalNum; i++) {
        currentNum++;
    }

Class Formatting:
-package and import statements should be the first thing in a file.

    package java.sample;

    import java.sample.Sample

-Next include a beginning comment in the following format at the top of every class.

    /*
     * SampleClassname
     * Class function: what does the class do/contain
     *
     * Author
     * Date
     */

-Include the class declaration next.
-Declare instance variables in the following order: public, protected, and private.
-Group methods by functionality.
