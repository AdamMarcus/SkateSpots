Description:
	We are developing an app for skateboarders and BMXers to drop pins on different spots to save them for later. Users would then be allowed to trade spots to other users, and eventually lead to a comprehensive map of spots across the world entirely compiled by the users. Users can rate different spots based on their quality, allowing skaters to explore new spots they would not have known about otherwise. Users will engage with the app by documenting a spot they know about, submitting it, and earning a new spot in return. The spots the skater is earning are spots they have not listed themselves and spots they have not received previously that have been listed by other users. This would motivate users to list more and more locations, driving the production of a comprehensive map of spots.

Vision Statement:
	To connect skateboarders and BMXers to unknown locations within their geographic proximity.

Motivation:
	Skaters trying to explore new spots may not have any way of finding viable places to try new tricks or just to explore. This app would enable a cooperative effort on the part of the users to provide a map of different spots, enabling skaters to find the best spots around them at home or in a new city they may not have explored before.

Risks:
	In experience in the languages we use
	Developing across multiple different environments
	Users not contributing to the map
	Users contributing spots that do not have a real attraction to skate.
	5 star spots becoming overpopulated with skaters due to overexposure by the app.
	Spots may have a certain amount of security or skating may “Not be allowed”

Risk Mitigation Plan:
	Try to get ahead of deadlines, start early
	Practicing on own time, leave spare time to learn languages
	Use virtual machines
	Users are required to contribute to receive new spots
	Add a rating feature, so if a spot gets extremely low ratings, it could be removed or skaters could neglect to visit it. Maybe add a “Not real spot” option that if enough people select it, the spot is removed.
	Allow a skater to have their own rating that is an average of the rating of their spots. If the skater is contributing high quality spots, they will also receive high quality spots, eliminating the risk of a 5 star spot getting overrun by 1 star skaters.
	Add a security rating. If skaters encounter security at a spot, they can list a time creating a calendar during the week of the best and worst times to visit.

Version Control:
	Github (Git)

Software Development Methodology:
	For our project we will use the agile development methodology. We will conduct daily meetings, no longer than 15 minutes, to update each other on progress and to explain any problems that are holding us up. We will also conduct bi-weekly demo sessions where we demonstrate a new feature or development that has been completed. In these bi-weekly meetings we will also specify our tasks, stories, for the next two weeks and break them up between team members.

Collaboration Tools:
	Version Control: Github (Git)
	Workflow: Trello
	Communication: Slack, Email, and text messaging.
