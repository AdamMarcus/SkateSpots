The app development are going slow since the current issues had not been solved yet. Communications through Trello and Slack has been proven to be very useful in organizing tasks for each team member, reporting the progress that they have made and solving problems together. We also encouraged speak up and ask help when we stuck on some problems in the future weeks so that we can come up with the solution as soon as possible. We are planning on making a more progress in app development and finishing the base structure and design of the app in the next iteration.2 Week PlanWeek 1:	Android Application:* User Interface completely laid out.* Login Screen (with create new user field)* Home Screen* Map Screen* Maps Screen* View user’s spots* Create new spot* Drop pin* Add attributes* Submit to database	Web Application:* Implement communication between web application and database* Build basic website to lookup and manage user information	Database:* Add currency field to user table.Week 2:	Android Application:* Cache user spots on local android device* Implement Currency* Implement Rating System* Add new activity for adding comments to a spot	Web Application:* Implement a Get User information handler* Implement a Save new spot handler* Implement purchase random spot handler	Database:* Add currency field to user table.
